These projects are part of freecodecamp's [Data Analysis with Python certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)

### Project 1: Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

### Project 2: Demographic Data Analyzer

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. You must use Pandas to answer various questions, like 'What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?' and 'What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?'
